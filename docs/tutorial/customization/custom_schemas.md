# Custom schemas in NOMAD

Custom schemas in NOMAD define how data is structured, stored, and displayed, allowing users to tailor NOMADâ€™s metainfo to their specific research requirements. With custom schemas, users can:

- Extend NOMAD's metainfo to support their experiment-specific data.
- Define data structures that dictate how information is organized and presented.
- Enable ELN functionality for manual data input and structured documentation.
- Extract structured data from files using parsers, which allow NOMAD to read data from raw files.
- Transform and enrich data post-upload using normalizers, ensuring compatibility with schema requirements and enhancing metadata consistency.


There are two primary approaches to creating custom schemas:

- **Python schemas**: These offer highest possible level of customization by allowing the integration of **custom parsers** and **normalizers**, enabling maximum automation.
- **Serialized schemas (YAML/JSON)**: Human-readable and easier to write and manage, ideal for defining customized ELNs without coding skills. However, they do not support normalizers.

This part of the tutorial covers the following topics:

- [YAML schemas](custom_yaml.md): Defining structured YAML schemas for NOMAD.
- [Custom ELN with YAML](custom_eln.md): Creating an ELN schema to enable structured metadata entry.
- [Tabular parser in YAML](custom_tabular.md): Utilizing the built-in tabular parser to process spreadsheet data.
- [Python schemas](custom_python.md): Exploring Python schemas and their advanced capabilities.
- [Normalizers](custom_normalizer.md): Implementing normalizers to automate data processing.
